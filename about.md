Hi. My name is Ryan. I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer at [Concur](https://concur.com). I graduated in 2013 from the University of Washington with a major in _Applied Computational Math Sciences_. I love to tinker with quantified-self and home-automation projects. 

### Hackathons
When I have an idea I jump on a keyboard and try it out.
* Rounding up Amazon purchases for charity? *Success*, Yahoo 2nd place
* NFC-based nutritional info lookup? *Fail*, AT&amp;T
* Music player with mobile-phone song voting? *Success*, Facebook 1st place [article](http://www.geekwire.com/2011/uw-students-mark-facebook-college-hackathon/)
* Fitbit RPG? *Fail* AT&amp;T
* Instant web-based group video chat (way before G+)? Google 2nd Place
* ...and more.

If you know of any hackathons coming up and want another team member, shoot me a message!

### Hobbies
When I'm not working or hacking I like to rock climb and lift.
